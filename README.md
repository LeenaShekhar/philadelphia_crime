# Philadelphia crime analysis

This is the analysis I did using Crime dataset available at Kaggle for Philadelphia. 

Some of the visualizations are as below:

All the crimes plotted on the map. We can see that mostly crimes happen in the centre of the city rather than the periphary.

Below we can visualize all the crimes colored accoring to different HQs.

It is also my first attempt in plotting Geo graphs using Basemap.
